Application: turn based multiplayer risk-like game. Players are humans and AIS. Coordination happens on the server via websocket.
Technology used: sveltekit, tailwindcss, typescript, cloudflare, websocket
Coding conventions: simplicity, readability, maintainability, good naming, modularity, minimal comments. Avoid duplication.
Goal: develop a reusable multiplayer game framework that I can use for the bases of other games.
Tips: prefer to fail fast, rather than silently continue. Prefer small single purposed classes, functions, and files.
